## DATE: 07-05-2025
## AIM:
To write a C program to find frequency of a character in the given input.

## Algorithm:
1. Start.
2. Define the required variable.
3. Write program to find frequency of a character.
4. Read the value using scanf.
5. Ask the user to make an input.
6. Print out the answer.
7. End

## Program:
```c program
#include<stdio.h> 
#include<string.h> 
int main()
{
int i,count=0,len;
char str[100],val[100]; 
scanf("%s %s",str,val); 
len=strlen(str); 
for(i=0;i<len;i++){
if(str[i]==val[0]) 
count++;
}printf("%d",count);}
```

## Output:
